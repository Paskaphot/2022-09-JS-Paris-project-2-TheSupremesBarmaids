        <p>
          For a successful cocktail, you have to make sure that the mixture is a
          perfect balance between strength, sweetness and acidity. It's about
          the rule of the 3S well known to our supreme bartenders (sweet, sour
          and strong).
        </p>
        <p>
          To find that fine balance that will make the unique flavor of your
          cocktail and will seduce your taste buds, limit the number of
          ingredients. From 5 ingredients, it becomes very difficult to manage
          the different flavors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also pay attention to their texture and their compatibility because
          yes the lemon makes the cream curdle for example.
