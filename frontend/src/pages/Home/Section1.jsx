        <p>
          The structure of a cocktail is always the same and is broken down into
          3 distinct parts: the base, the body and the aromatic touch.
        </p>
        <p>
          The base, most often a strong alcohol such as rum, vodka or the gin.
          sets the tone for the cocktail. She is the first brick of the mixture,
          the one on which the other bricks will lean.
        </p>
        <p>
          The body can be composed of several ingredients. He's there to
          lengthen it and give it more texture. This one maybe fizzy (soda),
          creamy (eggs) or thick (pureed fruits).
        </p>
        <p>
          The aromatic touch, on the other hand, makes it possible to affirm its
          character and/or to bring it a note of originality.
